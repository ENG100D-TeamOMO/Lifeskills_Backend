				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>It’s All About the Kids Foundation is a non-profit organization that creates new programs to benefit children’s charities in San Diego and Baja Mexico. 
				It’s All About the Kids® Foundation is aiming to help children from unprivileged areas and families from different perspectives, under the generosity of corporations and individuals.</p>
				<p>Children’s health and cognition development is one of the biggest issues concerned by educationalists and parents. 
				 Our project, Life Skills is such an educational product that teaches children ranging from four to thirteen years old life skills that are needed for the real world challenges. 
				 We work with Angela Brannon-Baptiste, the founder of It’s All About The Kids program, to modify and optimize the current game to accommodate the awarding system to encourage children to engage more in this game.
				 As mentioned above, our users are unprivileged children from four years old to thirteen years old. Due to shortage of funding, these children usually face the shortage of resources and tools needed to build necessary life skills. 
				 Articles show that some extremely useful life skills are rarely taught in schools such as personal finance problem and survival ability under danger. 
				 Furthermore, researches indicate that the death rate of children under 13 years old caused by accidents is inevitably high, which shows the necessity of life skill development. 
				 The reason for educationalists and parents to choose educational games is that data shows that educational games can influence children’s school performance by providing ways of fun challenge, stress relief, and companionship. 
				 Teachers are already using educational videos to prepare children from low-income families for kindergartens, and children also indicate that they feel more engaged when learning by playing games compared to other means of learning.</p>
